# Collection of styles
Collected from [BassCSS](https://basscss.com/) and [Picnic](https://picnicss.com/documentation#home)  
using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [rollup-plugin-css-porter](https://github.com/RJHwang/rollup-plugin-css-porter).  

!!! Deleted "grid" from BassCSS   

BassCSS using for functionality (typo, margin, padding, display ... ).   
Picnic using for components (buttons, forms, cards, blocks ...).

The rest did not change.

If you will change this - rename no_package.json right   
and `npm install`   
then rewrite it and `npm rollup --config`
